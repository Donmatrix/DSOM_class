# DSOM_class
A python class file for DSOM, an algorithm proposed by Rougier, Nicolas,Boniface, Yann in paper Dynamic self-organising map
The code is a part of work for implementing the algorithm proposed by Lo, Yat Long,Ghiassian, Sina, in their paper Overcoming Catastrophic Interference in Online Reinforcement Learning with Dynamic Self-Organizing Maps,NIPS 2019.
The code is more adaptive for reinforcement learning environment, such as gym. 
I use the following blog as reference to help coding: https://blog.csdn.net/u014028027/article/details/72458117
